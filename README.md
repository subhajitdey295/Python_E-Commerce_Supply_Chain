# E-Commerce Supply Chain Analysis Using Python

✔ Project Objective: The primary objective of this analysis is to visualize product pricing and the corresponding revenue generation, analyze sales distribution by product type, evaluate revenue contributions from various shipping carriers, and assess defect rates during shipping, utilizing Python for comprehensive data analysis.

✔ Data Cleaning (Pandas Library): Pandas was utilized for data manipulation and structuring the dataset for effective analysis. 

✔ Data Analysis: 
  ➡️ Make a visualization of the price of the products and the revenue generated by them: A positive correlation exists between product price and revenue, particularly pronounced in skincare products, indicating 
  that higher-priced skincare items contribute significantly to revenue.

  ➡️ Analyze the shipping cost of carriers: Carrier B has the highest shipping cost, exceeding $20K, possibly due to a higher shipment volume or expensive rates, while Carrier A and Carrier C have lower costs 
  between $10K and $15K, indicating fewer shipments or more cost-effective options.

✔ Data Visualization (Plotly Library): Utilized Plotlib library to create insightful bar, line and pie charts.

✔ Conclusion: Skincare is the top-selling category, Carrier B's high revenue comes with the highest shipping cost, road transport is the most expensive mode, and Haircare products have the highest defect rate, 
   highlighting the need for cost optimization, strategic transport management, and better packaging.
